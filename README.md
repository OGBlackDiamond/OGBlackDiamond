### About Me
Hello! I'm BlackDiamond. No, the name doesn't mean anything special, I just thought it sounded cool in elementary school and it stuck.

I'm currently 16 years old and an aspiring software engeneer as you may have guessed.

Check out some of my projects! (Disclaimer: Most projects are still a work in progress)
