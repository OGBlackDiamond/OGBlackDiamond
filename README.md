### About Me
Hello! I'm BlackDiamond. No, the name doesn't mean anything special, I just thought it sounded cool in elementary school and it stuck as my pseudoname for anything online.

I'm currently 16 years old and an aspiring software engeneer as you may have guessed.

Check out some of my projects! (Disclaimer: Most projects are still a work in progress)
* Project Aristotle - An AI virtual assistant that can remember conversations that it has, and can interact with you on a personal level!
* Tetris - A CLI for Tetris! Runs in several languages - currently implimented are Python and Java.
* firefox-user-styles - An automation script that allows you to import all of your custom `userChrome.css`, `userContent.css`, and `user.js` onto a new machine.
* FYRE2024 - The robot code for FRC team FYRE 5480 - I contribute heavily to this code base.
* turtle-overhaul - A websocktet interface to control computercraft turtles autonomously
* And more!
