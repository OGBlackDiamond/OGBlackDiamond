## About Me
Hello! I'm Caden. No, the name "BlackDiamond" doesn't mean anything special, I just thought it sounded cool in school and it stuck as my pseudoname online. I get it, its cringe, blah blah blah. I'm not creative enought to think of anything better.

Fedora Linux is my operating system of choice.

I enjoy tiling window managers.

I'm becoming a Neovim wizard.

My favorite language: **Java**<br/>
My best language: **Python**<br/>
I'm also fluent in:
* C++
* C#
* Lua

Languages I'm trying to learn:
* Javascript / Typescript
* Assembly


### *I do not use AI in any implementation to write my code*
