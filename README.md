### About Me
Hello! I'm Caden. No, the name "BlackDiamond" doesn't mean anything special, I just thought it sounded cool in elementary school and it stuck as my pseudoname for anything online. I get it, its cringe, blah blah blah. I'm not creative enought to think of anything better.

I'm currently 17 years old and an aspiring software engineer as you may have guessed.

Check out some of my projects! (Disclaimer: Most projects are still a work in progress)
* Proxy-Messages - A Minecraft Velocity/Paper plugin that provides customizable messages across the entire network when players join, leave, and switch between servers.
* Proxy-Portals - A Minecraft Paper plugin that allows users to register nether portals to transport them to other servers on the network.
* Project Aristotle - An AI virtual assistant that can remember conversations that it has, and can interact with you on a personal level!
* firefox-user-styles - An automation script that allows you to import all of your custom `userChrome.css`, `userContent.css`, and `user.js` onto a new machine.
* FYRE2024 - The robot code for FRC team FYRE 5480 - I contribute heavily to this code base.
* turtle-overhaul - A websocktet interface to control computercraft turtles autonomously
* And more!
